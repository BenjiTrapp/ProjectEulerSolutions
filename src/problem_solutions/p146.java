   * Right off the bat, we can exclude 90% of the candidates by the following observations:
   * - If n = 1 mod 2, then n^2 + 1 = 0 mod 2 which is composite.
   * - Thus we require n = 0 mod 2.
   * - If n = 1 mod 5, then n^2 + 9 = 0 mod 5 which is composite.
   * - If n = 2 mod 5, then n^2 + 1 = 0 mod 5 which is composite.
   * - If n = 3 mod 5, then n^2 + 1 = 0 mod 5 which is composite.
   * - If n = 4 mod 5, then n^2 + 9 = 0 mod 5 which is composite.
   * - Thus we require n = 0 mod 5.
   * - Taking these two together and using the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT), we require n = 0 mod 10.
   *
   * For each value of n, after we generate the set {n^2 + 1, n^2 + 3, ..., n^2 + 27}, it's more efficient to take each
   * prime number and test whether it divides any number, rather than take each number and test it against all prime numbers.
   * This is because some numbers in this set are prime so the latter method tests some numbers against all the primes;
   * the former method will bail out early as soon as ~any~ number in the set has a small prime factor.
   *
   * The rest of the algorithm is implemented straightforwardly.
